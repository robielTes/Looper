# Retrospective

## feedback

This was a very good and useful project. We have learned a lot of useful way of working with the group in the Agile Way, by adding a new feather to our project every week or so after we have our sprint meeting or when we are learning new things in class like,
- The creation of a new ORM or learning a new technology that we don't know like the route we have found and that is now working for us after 3 setbacks, each one with its own reason, from a broken dependency to a non-existent document.
- Or changing our development model from Git Flow to Trunk as we learn the pros and cons of each model.

## what worked well

- since the group is consisting of two members, we can make a decision or assign work quickly, saving us a lot of time.
- we have known each other since we were in cfc, therefore we know our limitations, this allows us to allocate the tasks based on our experience and skill levels, so we are very good at collaborating, like when we began the project, Filipe has started to work with the view and I with the model, after this, when he was working with ORM, I began to work with route.

## what did not work well

- At first we used a simple route that was fine, but as we were going forward we realized it wasn't good enough and we ended up having to spend extra time on a new route that was not planned.

- We had a few challenges in the last part of the project as Filipe made the decision to stop the CPNV even though we had finished most of the project by that time.


## How to organize the work in the group

When we started working on this project, we had already taken some GPR1 courses. So we decided to use the agile/kanban framework with the GitFlow development method, the GitHub project to track progress using issues and milestones and to share the code we use Github.

- In the beginning we created a lot of user stort with Dod and put them in the Product Backlog column.
- At the beginning of each spring, we move the user story we want to work on to the Sprint Backlog column.
- Then we assign the user story to someone or both of us as an Issue and place it in the in progre column.
- When the entire Dod is completed, we both approve it " before we wait for the teacher's approval".
- After being approved, we close the issue to move it to the "completed" column.
- Move to the next user story. Sometimes we work on several user stories at the same time.
